A VLO is a proactive, relationship-based partnership. Your VLO already knows your business, allowing them to provide faster, more strategic advice at a predictable monthly cost, ultimately preventing many problems from ever occurring.",

      question: "Why is the Strategic Plan custom-priced?",
      answer:
        "The Strategic Plan involves a much deeper, more integrated level of support, including participation in negotiations and board meetings. The scope of this work can vary significantly between businesses. A custom quote allows us to tailor a plan and price that perfectly matches the unique strategic needs of your company.",
